## Darien Library Envisionware Console

A suite of tools that we use internally to manage Envisionware and run custom reports. Uses Laravel 5.1

Be sure to run a `composer update` before using this:
```
composer update
nom install gulp
npm install gulp-install
npm install laravel-elixir
nom install bootstrap-sass
gulp
```

you're also going to want to copy `.env.example` to `.env` and add your values.
